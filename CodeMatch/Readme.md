The content in the LibDetectionDatabase.txt lists not all sources because some of the sources are no longer available.

For all JARs that are no longer available I have added an additional file MissingPackages.txt which lists the contained package names.
If find such a package in an APK you can extract and use it for library detection.

All lines in LibDetectionDatabase.txt which contain a semicolon need to be split by ';'.
The first column need to be downloaded and unzipped so that the path after the semicolon can be integrated into the database.

All rights for the JARs belong to the websites of the links. 
So if you want to use the JARs you need to follow the JARs' license rules.
